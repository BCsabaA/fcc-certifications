Build a Planet Class
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a class named Planet.
The Planet class should have an __init__ method that:
Has four parameters: self, name, planet_type, and star.
Raises a TypeError with the message name, planet type, and star must be strings if any of the arguments passed in is not a string type.
Raises a ValueError with the message name, planet_type, and star must be non-empty strings if any of the arguments passed in is an empty string.
Assigns the values passed in to the instance attributes name, planet_type, and star.
The Planet class should have an orbit method that returns a string in the format {name} is orbiting around {star}....
The Planet class should have a __str__ method that returns a string in the format Planet: {name} | Type: {planet_type} | Star: {star}.
You should create three instances of the Planet class named planet_1, planet_2, and planet_3.
You should print each planet object to see the __str__ method output.
You should call the orbit method on each planet object and print the result.
Tests
Waiting:1. You should create a class named Planet.
Waiting:2. The Planet class should have an __init__ method.
Waiting:3. The __init__ method should have four parameters: self, name, planet_type, and star, in this order.
Waiting:4. The __init__ method should raise a TypeError with the message name, planet type, and star must be strings if the first argument passed in is not a string type.
Waiting:5. The __init__ method should raise a TypeError with the message name, planet type, and star must be strings if the second argument passed in is not a string type.
Waiting:6. The __init__ method should raise a TypeError with the message name, planet type, and star must be strings if the third argument passed in is not a string type.
Waiting:7. The __init__ method should raise a ValueError with the message name, planet_type, and star must be non-empty strings if the first argument passed in is an empty string.
Waiting:8. The __init__ method should raise a ValueError with the message name, planet_type, and star must be non-empty strings if the second argument passed in is an empty string.
Waiting:9. The __init__ method should raise a ValueError with the message name, planet_type, and star must be non-empty strings if the third argument passed in is an empty string.
