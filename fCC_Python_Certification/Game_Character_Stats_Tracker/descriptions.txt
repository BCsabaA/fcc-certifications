Build a Game Character Stats Tracker
In this lab, you'll build a game character stats tracker. The program will allow you to create a character with specific attributes, update those attributes, and retrieve the current stats of the character.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

Create a class named GameCharacter that represents a game character and manages character stats.

When instantiated, a new GameCharacter object should have the following attributes:

_name set to the string given at the moment of the instantiation.
_health set to 100.
_mana set to 50.
_level set to 1.
Create a name property for read-only access to the character's name.

For the health property:

Define a getter that returns the current health.
Define a setter that prevents health from being set below 0, and caps the health at 100.
For the mana property:

Define a getter that returns the current mana.
Define a setter that prevents mana from being set below 0, and caps the mana at 50.
Create a getter for level to return the character's current level.

Define a method named level_up that:

Increases the character's level by 1.
Resets health to 100 and mana to 50 using their corresponding property setters.
Prints a message in the form of <name> leveled up to <level>! (where <name> and <level> should be replaced by the character's name and new level, respectively).
Define a __str__ method that returns a formatted string including:

The character's name.
The character's level.
The character's current health.
The character's current mana.
For example, a character named Kratos, right after the instantiation, should be represented as the following:

Name: Kratos
Level: 1
Health: 100
Mana: 50
Usage example
Example Code
hero = GameCharacter('Kratos') # Creates a new character named Kratos
print(hero)  # Displays the character's stats

hero.health -= 30  # Decreases health by 30
hero.mana -= 10    # Decreases mana by 10
print(hero)  # Displays the updated stats

hero.level_up()  # Levels up the character
print(hero)  # Displays the stats after leveling up
