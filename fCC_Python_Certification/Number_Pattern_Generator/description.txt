Build a Number Pattern Generator
In this lab you will practice the basics of Python by building a small app that creates a number pattern.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define a function named number_pattern that takes a single parameter n (representing a positive integer).
number_pattern should use a for loop.
number_pattern(n) should return a string with all the integers starting from 1 up to n (included) separated by a space. For example, number_pattern(4) should return the string 1 2 3 4.
If the argument passed to the function is not an integer value, the function should return Argument must be an integer value..
If the argument passed to the function is less than 1, the function should return Argument must be an integer greater than 0..
Tests
Waiting:1. You should have a number_pattern function.
Waiting:2. The number_pattern function should have one parameter named n.
Waiting:3. number_pattern(4) should return 1 2 3 4.
Waiting:4. number_pattern(12) should return 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.
Waiting:5. number_pattern should return a space separated list of numbers for any positive integer.
Waiting:6. number_pattern should return Argument must be an integer value. when passed a value that is not an integer.
Waiting:7. number_pattern should return Argument must be an integer greater than 0. when passed a non-positive integer.
