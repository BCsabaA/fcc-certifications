Implement the Quicksort Algorithm
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define a function named quick_sort to implement the quicksort algorithm.

The quick_sort function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list of these integers in sorted order from least to greatest.

To implement the algorithm, you should:

Choose a pivot value from the elements of the input list (use the first or the last element of the list).
Partition the input list into three sublists: one with elements less than the pivot, one with elements equal to the pivot, and one with elements greater than the pivot.
Recursively call quick_sort to sort the sublists and concatenate the sorted sublists to produce the final sorted list.
Tests
Waiting:1. You should have a function named quick_sort.
Waiting:2. Your quick_sort function should take a single parameter.
Waiting:3. quick_sort([]) should return an empty list.
Waiting:4. Your quick_sort function should not modify the list passed to it as the argument.
Waiting:5. quick_sort([20, 3, 14, 1, 5]) should return [1, 3, 5, 14, 20].
Waiting:6. quick_sort([83, 4, 24, 2]) should return [2, 4, 24, 83].
Waiting:7. quick_sort([4, 42, 16, 23, 15, 8]) should return [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].
Waiting:8. quick_sort([87, 11, 23, 18, 18, 23, 11, 56, 87, 56]) should return [11, 11, 18, 18, 23, 23, 56, 56, 87, 87].
Waiting:9. You should not use the built-in sorted() function in your code.
Waiting:10. You should not use the sort() method in your code.
